# DspILSAnalyzer

A mod that displays information about ILS.  
Currently shows planets, the planets ILS, what items the ILS contains, number of items, if they are in supply or demand and the coordinates of the ILS.  

Data is written periodically (5s) to a file ($MyDocuments$/dsp_ILS_analyzer.txt).
